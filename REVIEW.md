Names (3):
-names are generally good, but can sometimes be somewhat non-descriptive/ambiguus

Comments (2):
-comments are generally present and good, but are not always sufficient for understanding the code. A short highlevel comment of the task of each method would be pleasant.

Headers (1):
-header comments are missing

Layout (4)

Flow (4):
-Code has good generality; few if/else statements needed, flow through code is straightforward
Decomposition (3): 
-code exists of few but quite large methods; nonetheless the decomposition is sensible. further decomposition might be possible, but probably not necessary

Formatting (4):
-format is clearly visible

Idiom (3):
-library/datatype functionality usage is sensible
-using a string to store all movies is a neat manner but might require more lines of code to process

Decomposition (3):
-creation of variables can be ommitted by passing them as parameters to functions

Modularization (3): 
-good, functions are largely independent
